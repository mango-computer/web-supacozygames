## 🎮 What is Supa Cozy Games?

Supa Cozy Games is an indie game in development where players help a small town rediscover happiness through farming, exploration, and connection.  
Characters and interactions are powered by AI, allowing deeper emotional bonds and dynamic storytelling.

Our goal is to create a game that comforts, inspires, and grows alongside its players — pixel by pixel, system by system.
